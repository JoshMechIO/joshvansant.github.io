I am a researcher and engineering with interests including soft robotics, emboddied intelligence, and compliant mechanisms. Currently, I am conducting research on SMA-actuated soft robotics grippers for space applications at TU Delft's BioMorphic Lab. I am also gaining practical experience by working as a design engineer at ISISpace. 

I am endlessly inspired and curious by the fascinating possibilities of bio-inspired design combined with soft robotics and embodied intelligence and am therefore seeking to pursue a PhD to further explore soft, bio-inspired robotics for applications in space or medical fields.
