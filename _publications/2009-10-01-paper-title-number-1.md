This thesis therefore presents the design, modelling and evaluation of a compliant bi-state switching mechanism designed for fabrication from a silicon wafer and integrated with the horizontal clutch and braking system sub-components of mechanical chronographs. The functional requirements of the chronograph sub-functions include reliable switching between the engaged and braking states, secure gear engagement with minimal misalignment during the engaged state, and precise timekeeping through minimal brake timing delay and slippage of the chronograph seconds hand during the braked state. The design is modelled and validated using both an analytical pseudo-rigid body model and a numerical finite element model. A scaled PETG-based proof-of-concept was then fabricated to verify the performance. (Under embargo until 21-10-2026)
